    "When we scrape the web, we write code that sends a request to the server that’s hosting the page we specified. Generally, our code downloads that page’s source code, just as a browser would. But instead of displaying the page visually, it filters through the page looking for HTML elements we’ve specified, and extracting whatever content we’ve instructed it to extract.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we wanted to get all of the titles inside H2 tags from a website, we could write some code to do that. Our code would request the site’s content from its server and download it. Then it would go through the page’s HTML looking for the H2 tags. Whenever it found an H2 tag, it would copy whatever text is inside the tag, and output it in whatever format we specified."
